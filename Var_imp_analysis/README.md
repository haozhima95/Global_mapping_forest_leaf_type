# Variable importance analysis

### This folder contains scripts analysing variable importances in the variations of deciduous proportion and broadleaved proportion. All these files can construct _Fig.3_ in the manuscript. 

- The file named "[play_with_functional_type.Rmd](Var_imp_analysis/play_with_functional_type.Rmd)" contains codes and functions returning variable importance of principal components of different environmental characteristics. 

- The file named "[play_with_types.Rmd](Var_imp_analysis/play_with_types.Rmd)" contains codes and functions returning variable importance of individual variables. 

- The file named "[var_imp.Rmd](Var_imp_analysis/var_imp.Rmd)" contains codes for developing bar plots for _Fig.3_.
