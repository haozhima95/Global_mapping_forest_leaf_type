# Global_mapping_leaf_habits

### This repository contains the codes for mapping global forest leaf types. 

- The folder named "[Data_preparation](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_forest_leaf_type/tree/master/Data_preparation)" contains codes for aggreagting datasets for mapping in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). 

- The folder named "[Global summary](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_forest_leaf_type/tree/master/Global_summary)" saves .Rmd files for constructing _Fig.1_ in the manuscript. 

- The folder named "[Mapping_code](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_forest_leaf_type/tree/master/mapping_code)" contains files and functions for mapping global forest leaf types and future leaf types in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/). 

- The folder named "[Var_imp_analysis](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_forest_leaf_type/tree/master/Var_imp_analysis)" includes .Rmd scripts to construct _Fig.3_ in the manuscript. 

- The foder named "[tree_counting](https://github.com/haozhima95/Global_mapping_forest_leaf_type/tree/master/tree_counting)" includes .Rmd and .js scripts run in [Rstudio](https://posit.co/) and [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) to estimate total number of trees acorss the globe in four different leaf types. These functions and scripts enables to construct _Fig.4_ in the manuscript.
