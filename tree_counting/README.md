# Counting trees in different leaf types globally

### This folder contains files and scripts that can estimate the total amount of trees on the Earth or in different biomes. This folder helps to construct _Fig.4_ in the manuscript. 

- **To map tree density in different leaf types**, run "[tree_density_mapping.js](tree_counting/tree_density_mapping.js)" in Google Earth Engine. 

- **To estimate total amount of trees in four leaf types globally**, run "[tree_counting.js](tree_counting/tree_counting.js)" in Google Earth Engine. 

- **To estimate total number of trees in different biomes**, run "[treecounting_in_biomes.js](tree_counting/treecounting_in_biomes.js)" in Google earth Engine. After exporting .csv files from this script, run "[biome_tree_counting.Rmd](tree_counting/biome_tree_counting.Rmd)" to construct _Fig.4_.
